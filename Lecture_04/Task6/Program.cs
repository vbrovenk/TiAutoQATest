// Write an abstract class Lightstring.  Expand it with simple and colored Lightstring classes.
// As elements of the Lightstring, use the class Bulb and Colored Bulb.

// A colored light bulb has a color that can be red, yellow, blue or green.
// For a colored light bulb, it should be possible to set the color using the Color type,
// and get the color as a string.
// For a colored Lightstring, when creating, set the color of the light bulb
// depending on the multiplicity of the serial number (1 - red, 2 - yellow, 3 - green, 4 - blue, 5 - red, etc.)
// The number of lights in the Lightstring is set by the user.
// The state of the bulb (on - off) is calculated from its serial number in the garland and the current minute of time.
// If the current minute is even, only the bulbs with an even number in the garland are lit.
// If the current minute is odd, the odd-numbered lights are on.

// For both lightstrings, create a method that returns the current state of the lights (on/off)
// and the color in the case of a colored one.

// Print the current state of both lightstrings to the console by calling the implemented class methods.
